NeuroScreen is a mobile application that leverages lightweight neural network models (TensorFlow Lite) to provide early screening for Autism, Dyslexia, and Dementia. Designed for accessibility and performance, the app integrates on-device and cloud-based learning to deliver fast, accurate, and real-time assessments.

Each condition is approached with a tailored screening method to demonstrate the versatility of neural networks in healthcare diagnostics:

Autism Screening: Utilizes a structured Android-based questionnaire enhanced with a neural model that evaluates behavioral patterns in real-time.

Dyslexia Detection: Employs a pattern recognition script that analyzes reading and writing inputs to identify potential indicators of dyslexia.

Dementia Diagnosis: Features an interactive memory-based game that collects cognitive response data, which is then processed by a neural model to assess signs of dementia.
